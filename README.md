The purpose of doing it, just to help friends and anyone interested in watching their favorite channels Live.

   For example (Recommended) Kodi link: https://kodi.tv/, since it supports most OS you may use to watch... like Smart T.V, T.V. box, smart phone, PC, and Laptop.
   
   On Andriod, I recommend an app named "IPTV" link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iptvremote.android.iptv, very easy to use and UI is good. (contains few ADS, but also there is a full version without ADS by 3$)
